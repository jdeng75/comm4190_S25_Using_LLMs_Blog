    "While I didn’t end up building a better version of Spotify DJ, the process of analyzing my own music taste was surprisingly insightful on its own. It helped me better understand my listening patterns and how much my preferences shift depending on the moment. I’m especially curious about how GPT-4o might approach recommending new music based on my history—possibly in a more dynamic or personalized way than Spotify's existing DJ.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "From what I can tell, Spotify DJ likely uses a mix of audio feature–based similarity and collaborative filtering. That makes sense for matching my tastes with popular trends and similar users, but I’m more intrigued by how a machine learning approach—like k-means clustering—could offer an entirely different way to group my preferences and suggest songs. For instance, I’m not convinced that mood or genre tagging alone would work well for me, since I might want classical music after an upbeat playlist. My listening doesn’t always follow a predictable emotional or genre path.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes me think that a model trained on listening context or deeper audio features could unlock something more fluid and personalized. It’s definitely a project I want to revisit when I have more time. There’s real potential in going beyond the DJ’s prebuilt logic and experimenting with unsupervised learning to build a truly adaptive music recommendation tool.\n",
