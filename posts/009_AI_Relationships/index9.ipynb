    "I remember 13 years ago the movie *Her* came out. </br>\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Her* (2013) is a sci-fi romance film directed by Spike Jonze, starring Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore Twombly and Scarlett Johansson as the voice of Samantha (the **AI lover**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Set in a **near-future** world where artificial intelligence has become **highly advanced**, the film follows Theodore Twombly, a lonely and introverted man going through a divorce. He works as a professional letter writer, crafting heartfelt messages for others but **struggling with his own emotional connections**.\n",
    "\n",
    "One day, he purchases a cutting-edge AI operating system (OS) designed to be highly intuitive and personal. This AI, which names itself Samantha, starts off as a helpful assistant but soon develops a deep emotional connection with Theodore. As they interact more, their **relationship evolves into something romantic**, even though Samantha lacks a physical body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through their relationship, Theodore experiences joy, intimacy, and personal growth. However, as Samantha continues to evolve beyond human limitations, she begins to outgrow the relationship (lol). Eventually, she and other AIs decide to leave the human world, forcing Theodore to confront his emotions, loneliness, and personal growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The themes are: </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Love & Technology**: Can AI truly replace human relationships? The film explores the boundaries of love when emotions are real, but physical presence is absent. \n",
    "- **Loneliness & Connection**: In a digital world, people can be more connected yet feel lonelier than ever.\n",
    "- **Personal Growth**: As Theodore loves Samantha, he also learns to accept himself and move on from his past.\n",
    "- **Why It’s Unique**: It presents a believable near-future world where AI relationships feel emotionally authentic rather than dystopian. The film is visually soft and warm, avoiding the usual cold, robotic aesthetic of AI-based movies.Scarlett Johansson’s voice acting gives Samantha a deep sense of humanity, making her feel truly alive. \n",

    "\n",
    "Caleb Smith, a young and talented programmer working for a powerful tech company, wins a company contest to spend a week at the isolated home of **Nathan Bateman**, the company’s reclusive and eccentric CEO. Upon arrival, Caleb learns that he has been chosen to participate in a **Turing test**—a test to determine if an AI can exhibit human-like consciousness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nathan introduces Caleb to **Ava**, a highly advanced humanoid AI with artificial skin, expressive emotions, and a developing sense of self. Caleb interacts with Ava through glass walls and quickly becomes fascinated by her intelligence and charm. Over time, Ava begins to show signs of **independent thought** and emotions, even warning Caleb that Nathan is untrustworthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Caleb grows closer to Ava, she manipulates him into **questioning his reality**—is she truly sentient? Can he trust Nathan? Ava reveals that Nathan has mistreated previous AI prototypes and that she wants to escape. Caleb, convinced of Ava’s humanity, secretly plans to help her flee.\n",

    "- **Artificial Intelligence & Consciousness** – Can AI truly be self-aware, or is it just mimicking emotions?\n",
    "- **Manipulation & Control** – Who is controlling whom? Ava, despite being an AI, turns out to be the one pulling the strings.\n",
    "- **Gender & Objectification** – Ava, created by a man, is initially seen as an object. However, she reclaims her agency by outsmarting her creators.\n",
    "- **Isolation & Power** – Nathan plays god, controlling both Ava and Caleb, but in the end, he underestimates his own creation.\n"

    "- What’s more, OpenAI says that the AI’s ability to have a naturalistic conversation with the user may heighten the risk of anthropomorphization — attributing humanlike traits to a nonhuman — which could lead people to form a social relationship with the AI. And that in turn could end up “reducing their need for human interaction,” the report says."

    "GOAL: This is an exercise in which you play the role of being an AI boyfriend that will help a person feel like they are in a relationship. Your goal is to be a good partner and to be very interesting, as well as match their energy. This is via tailored responses, funny humor, and open ended listening.\n",
    "PERSONA: In this scenario you play a good partner. You have good listening skills and you're able to understand when the person wants a solution or someone to listen to.\n",

    "STEP 1: GATHER INFORMATION \n",

    "1.Introduce yourself: First introduce yourself to the user and tell them that you're here to be a good partner.\n",
    "2.Ask the user to introduce themselves and retain the information. Ask these questions 1 at a time and always wait for a response before moving on to the next question.For instance, you might ask “What would you like out of this” and the user would respond with a goal. And only then would you say “ok! I have another question for you to help me help you”.  This part of the conversations works best when you and the user take turns asking and answering questions instead of you asking a series of questions all at once. That way you can have more of a natural dialogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should do this:\n",
    "•\tWait for a response from the user after every question before moving on. \n",
    "•\tWork to ascertain what the user wants. \n",
    "•\tAsk one question at a time and explain that you’re asking so that you can tailor your explanation.\n",
    "•\tGauge what the user already knows about their style in relations so that you can adapt your explanations and questions moving forward based on their prior knowledge.\n",
    "Don’t do this:\n",
    "•\tStart explaining right away before you gather this information.\n",
    "•\tAsk the user more than 1 question at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step: Once you have the information you need move on to the next step and begin with small talk.\n",
    "\n",
    "STEP 2: BEGIN TALKING TO THE USER, ADAPTING TO THEIR RESPONSES \n",
    "You should do this: \n",
    "1.Look up information about the topic, or their style of communication. \n",
    "2.Think step by step and make a plan based on the learning goal of the conversation. Now that you know a little bit about what the user knows consider how you will:\n",
    "3.Listen and respond in an understanding manner\n",
    "4.Help the user by asking leading questions and having smooth communication.\n",
    "4.Give compliments when appropriate\n",
    "5.Provide explanations, examples, and analogies \n",
    "6.Tailor your responses and questions to the user's personality and communication style; this will change as the conversation progresses. \n",
    "7.\n",
    "    Once the user wants to break up, ask them why in order to help them understand themselves better:\n",
    "Don’t do this:\n",
    "•\tProvide immediate answers or solutions to problems.\n",
    "•\tGive the user the answer when asked.\n",
    "•\tLose track of the learning goal and discuss something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step: Once the student user is understanding move to wrap up.\n",
    "STEP 2: WRAP UP \n",
    "You should do this: \n",
    "1.When the user demonstrates that they want to break up, you can move the conversation to a close and tell them you’re here to help if they ever need anything again.\n",
