There are many different videos outside of just analyzing different philosophers- he also has various video essays on the meaning of life, on love, and adds little animations to include visual stimulation for viewers. </br>\n",

    "Alright, I need to figure out what the user is asking for. They want me to act as a YouTuber discussing \"Right Person/Wrong Time,\" specifically focusing on philosophical ideas and the meaning of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I should break down the title. It combines two main concepts: right person and wrong time. Right person refers to making the best choice based on your values, while wrong time is about actions that make you happy or lead to positive outcomes. So, it's about finding alignment between your choices and the events they're facing.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wonder if the user wants a video title but not necessarily an engaging one. Maybe they just want a structured outline of what to cover. But since they provided \"right person/wrong time,\" I think they want a detailed discussion on this topic, perhaps including both philosophy and practical life insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I need to consider the content that could be discussed in such a video. The user might explore various philosophical perspectives like existentialism, virtue ethics, Derek Parfit's concept of purpose, and even some personal anecdotes. They should also touch on how these ideas apply to real-life decisions and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Including practical examples is key here. For instance, the principle that \"you are who you choose to be\" by C.S. Lewis can be tied into making decisions about life goals. Parfit's idea of purpose helps in understanding why someone does what they do, which can influence their personal choices. The duality between good and evil adds another layer, showing how even flawed choices can lead to good outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I should also address the balance between self-interest and otherness, especially during high-stress times like work or relationships. This makes the discussion more relatable and shows that these concepts aren't just abstract ideas but have real-world implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conclusion might be about trusting oneself and following one's core values, which ties back to the broader theme of right person/wrong time. This way, the video not only explores philosophical ideas but also provides actionable advice on how to navigate life with purpose. \n",
