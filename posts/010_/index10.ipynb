There's a whole list of popular GPTs in my workspace which include; Love Run Half-Marathon Training GPT, Interactive Cooking & Recipe Innovator, Rental Analyzer, ConsultingDad.AI, and much more. The list seems infinite! And so niche to a lot of people's different interests. The more I keep looking, the more my jaw keeps dropping. If I knew about these earlier, I think my life would be easier."
