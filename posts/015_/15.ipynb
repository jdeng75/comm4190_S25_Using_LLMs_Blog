    "I grew up in a polyglot household. I grew up with my mom, dad, paternal aunt (姑妈 gū mā), and paternal grandparents (阿嫲 a maa and 阿爺 a ye). Everyone spoke at least 5 languages: **Mom** knew Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Hakka, and English. **Dad** and his side spoke their **village language**, Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese, English, Thai and Lao. </br>\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "So...it came to no surprise that I didn't know how to speak any language properly. Like. Seriously. I was put in ESL until second grade. My guma told me that I used to be able to sing in Vietnamese and the village language, while my mom told me that I used to mix up Cantonese and Mandarin all the time. The languages congealed, and I would always create odd sentence structures through a combination of everything I heard. No wonder why, even as an adult, I end up making my own words and creating sentences that only make sense to me. </br>\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "I decided on English because it was the easiest and most used language. But by deciding on that, I lost a lot of retention in these other Asian languages. Especially after my grandparents died, my vocabulary reduced 10 fold. </br>\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\"It's ok though\" I thought. Half the world speaks Mandarin. No one in my family really speaks Hakka. Cantonese is a little harder to learn, but all of Hong Kong speaks it and Southern China. Thai and Lao are well known. But I was stumped on the village language. There's no written record, only my dad and aunt speak it together now, and **I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED TO SEARCH IT UP**. </br>\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "I could only **BARELY** understand it... but my dads side all spoke it during their reunions. I was pissed. I kept asking every year if they could teach me, but all they said was \"it's a dying language. Once we pass, you'll probably never hear it again.\" **HOW IS THIS SUPPOSED TO HELP ME**. </br>\n",
