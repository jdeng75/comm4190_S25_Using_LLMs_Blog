    "\n",
    "All of the popular AI tools developed at UPenn have been incredibly helpful, especially because each one was clearly created with a specific purpose in mind. I really appreciated how well-structured and focused the chatboxes were. They made it easy to get direct, relevant answers without much effort on my end. That said, I‚Äôm still a bit skeptical about the tarot card bot; while it was fun, it felt less grounded than the others in terms of utility.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, I realized that if I hadn‚Äôt used these pre-built chatboxes, I probably could‚Äôve asked regular ChatGPT the same questions and gotten similar information. The difference, though, is in the experience: these custom bots made the process far more straightforward and structured. Instead of figuring out how to frame my questions, the design and prompt engineering behind each chatbox did the heavy lifting for me. It made me think more about how curation and context can shape how we interact with AI‚Äîand how even a general tool like ChatGPT becomes significantly more powerful with the right scaffolding.\n",
