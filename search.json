    "text": "Posting Pictures for ChatGPT\n\nIn this blog post, I will be uploading pictures to ChatGPT.\nThis experiment is to see whether ChatGPT can accurately describe the scene.\n\n\n1. Picture of a Switzerland Keychain\n\nJenn: “Can you describe what this photo is to me? And what this object is?”\n\n\n\nChatGPT: This photo shows a person wearing black gloves holding a keychain. The keychain is heart-shaped and made of wood, featuring an illustration of Interlaken, Switzerland. It has the Swiss flag on it, along with mountains and buildings, likely representing the scenic landscape of the town. The keychain is attached to a metal ring for keys.The packaging label at the top is red, displaying the brand name Alberto SA. It has a barcode and a price tag indicating Fr. 8.– (Swiss Francs). The background suggests a store setting, possibly a souvenir shop, with other keychains and items on display.\n\n\nJenn’s Observations: I think ChatGPT was able to accurately describe the picture!\n\n\n\n2. Picture of ‘Babel’ at Tate Modern in London\n\nJenn: “Can you tell me who made this, what it is, where it’s located, and why it was created?”\n\n\n\nChatGPT: Yes! This is a well-known art installation called Babel by the artist Cildo Meireles. What is it?: Babel is a towering installation made from hundreds of stacked radios from different time periods and styles. The radios are arranged in a cylindrical structure, with some turned on and emitting faint sounds, creating a layered auditory experience. Where is it located?: It is part of the collection at the Tate Modern in London, though it may be exhibited elsewhere in temporary installations. Why was it created?: Cildo Meireles created Babel as a commentary on communication, information overload, and miscommunication in the modern world. The name refers to the Biblical Tower of Babel, a story in which human ambition to reach the heavens led to the confusion of languages, causing people to be unable to understand each other. Similarly, the installation suggests the overwhelming and often chaotic nature of mass communication today. If you saw this in a different museum, it could be on loan or part of a traveling exhibition!\n\n\nJenn’s Observations: It’s interesting how ChatGPT was still able to detect that it was Babel, even though there was a person who was in the way of the art piece. I liked how it mentions that if I saw it at a different museum that it was probably apart of a traveling exhibition.\n\n\n\n3. Picture of one side of the Sagrada Familia\n\nJenn: “What is this, where is this, who created it, and why was it created?”\n\n\n\nChatGPT: This is a photo of the interior of the Sagrada Família, a world-famous basilica located in Barcelona, Spain. What is this? The image captures the breathtaking stained glass windows and organic, tree-like columns inside the Sagrada Família. The interplay of natural light and vibrant colors is a hallmark of this architectural masterpiece. Who created it? The Sagrada Família was designed by the renowned Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí. Construction began in 1882, and it remains unfinished to this day, with ongoing work continuing in accordance with Gaudí’s vision. Why was it created? Gaudí envisioned the Sagrada Família as a deeply spiritual and symbolic structure, blending Gothic and Art Nouveau styles with naturalistic forms. The basilica was created as a place of worship and devotion, meant to inspire awe and reflect Christian faith through architecture. The organic, tree-like columns, geometric details, and stained glass windows were all meticulously designed to create a harmonious and immersive experience. It is one of the most visited landmarks in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, drawing millions of visitors annually. The goal is to complete its construction by 2032, marking the 150th anniversary of Gaudí’s death.\n\n\nJenn’s Observations: Even though I only showed a small portion, ChatGPT was still able to guess the location accurately. I am impressed.\n\n\nOverall, I am impressed by how accurate ChatGPT was when trying to guess what objects/places were in my photos. Perhaps next time, I will try to draw pictures (horribly) to see if ChatGPT can decipher my images."

    "text": "Guestimation and Making Graphs in R\n\nI also want to learn how to code more in R, and I really like graphs\nI’m going to ask ChatGPT if they can give me code to make graphs.\nThese questions will be guestimations on what ChatGPT thinks of certain trend lines.\n\n\nLet’s cook.\n\n1. Years Lived vs Amount of Friends\n\nJenn asks: Can you create R code for a graph to show your guestimation on years lived vs amount of friends.\n\n\nChatGPT:\n \n\n\nWhen I asked why there was this trend, ChatGPT responded with &gt; The trend I used in the R code is based on general social patterns observed in human friendships over a lifetime. Here’s why I shaped it that way: &gt;1. Friendships Peak in Young Adulthood (20s-30s) People tend to have the most friends in their teens and 20s, especially in school, university, or early careers. Social environments like college, sports, clubs, and workplaces provide many opportunities for new friendships. There’s generally more free time for social activities before major life commitments (e.g., demanding careers, marriage, parenting). &gt;2. Gradual Decline in Middle Age (30s-50s) In the 30s and 40s, people often prioritize careers, families, and personal responsibilities, leading to less time for socializing. Some friendships naturally fade due to geographical moves, lifestyle changes, or shifting priorities. However, a smaller core group of close friends often remains. &gt;3. Further Decline in Older Age (60s-80s) Retirement, health issues, and the loss of peers contribute to fewer active friendships. Many elderly people rely more on family, close lifelong friends, or community groups rather than maintaining large social circles. Some older adults reconnect with old friends or develop new friendships in retirement communities, but the overall trend is downward. &gt; Why This Trend Makes Sense? Social networks are largest in early adulthood when we have high social mobility and opportunity. Life responsibilities impact time and effort spent on friendships as we grow older. Aging naturally reduces social engagement, with some maintaining strong bonds but a smaller total number of friends. Of course, this is a generalization—individual experiences vary widely! Some people maintain or even expand their social circles in later years. Would you like me to adjust the model to include different factors, such as personality types or social media influence?\nAnd honestly, I think their prediction and trend line is correct. Let us move on…\n\n\n\n2. Age vs Breast Cancer Rates\n\nJenn asks: and can you write code for age vs breast cancer rates &gt; ChatGPT: &gt; &gt;  &gt; \nWhen I ask why they think it exhibits this trend: &gt; Why This Trend? &gt; Young women (20-30s): Very low breast cancer rates. Middle age (40-50s): Rates begin to rise due to hormonal and genetic factors. Older age (60-80s): Highest incidence rates, as risk accumulates over time. This is a simplified model based on general trends seen in epidemiology. Would you like a more specific model with real-world data, or adjustments to include factors like genetic risk?"

    "text": "Love in the Age of AI: Can Machines Understand Romantic Poems?\n\n\nCurrent AI systems cannot have emotions in the sense that humans do… but are they able to detect and analyze human emotion?\n\n\nWhile they can be programmed to recognized and respond to human emotions, they can simulate emotional responses without truly feeling them\n\n\nI want to see if AI is able to read love poems and analyze them to the extent that human beings analyze them. Let’s get started!\n\n\n\nA guy wrote me a poem a while ago called “On Fighting Transience” and I never understood what it really meant\n\nJenn: There is a love poem called “On Fighting Transience”, what does this title mean to you?\n\n\nChatGPT:  The title “On Fighting Transience” suggests a struggle against impermanence—perhaps an attempt to hold onto something fleeting, like love, beauty, or life itself. It evokes a deeply romantic and philosophical idea: the desire to resist the inevitable passage of time and the loss that comes with it. In the context of a love poem, it could explore themes like:  Eternal love despite the impermanence of life.  Cherishing moments before they slip away.  Memory and longing—trying to preserve a love that has passed.  Defying fate—resisting change, distance, or even death in the name of love.  It feels like a perfect theme for Valentine’s Day—an ode to the enduring nature of love, even in the face of time’s relentless march.\n\n\nJenn: Here is the poem, please tell me what it means and how you analyze it \n\n\nOn Fighting Transience  My favorite authors create from memory,  write odes and odysseys sparked by recollection,  scrape the walls of their skulls prodding poetry to life.  You do the same, subtly  showering me with stories of family til tears line your face,  soft sobbing like slow plucks of violin strings,  turning tension to beauty and I want to cherish  this moment for a little while longer.  Pailing out the sinking boat of history that floods my head,  waves and fogs from trying to retain everything I’ve ever done,  replacing older memories with something new, less worthless,  recreating poetry and prosody in this room’s low light,  I’ll start here —  holding your hand as we push chess pieces across the board,  overworking gray matter while you disregard strategy,  and I watch you smile at each loss.  Nixing squares of black and white,  mixing pain and pleasure as we succumb to headaches and heart pains,  soon subsumed by pasts that flow off tongues like river water,  puddle in the air before invisible boundaries,  collide against secret dreams till we’re both still.  Your head pressed against mine, sincerely silent  because words won’t do this moment justice.  Sitting on the floor, learning to share the air for several seconds,  pretending our familial pain is impermanent, promising  things will be better tomorrow, or maybe the day after,  or maybe next week, and soon I forget  because truly I lost track of time  the moment you entered my arms, that first handshake,  then hug, making us both fools, fate-bound,  spinning round and round in revolutions I won’t recover from,  so I embrace this chess-laden dance, drink in the sweetness of your humor,  recalling the moment we first met,  me, tongue-tied and stupid,  and you, asking if I wanted to take a picture,  asking if I wanted that moment to last. \n\n\nChatGPT: Analysis of On Fighting Transience\n\nThis poem is a deeply emotional meditation on memory, love, and the struggle against impermanence. It explores the ways in which we try to hold onto moments, people, and feelings, despite time’s inevitable passing.\nTheme 1: Memory as a Tool for Fighting Time\nThe poem begins with a reflection on how authors and poets create from memory, turning recollections into lasting art. The speaker admires this ability, yet seems to struggle with their own attempts to do the same. There’s an urgency in the lines:\n\nPailing out the sinking boat of history that floods my head,\nwaves and fogs from trying to retain everything I’ve ever done,\n\nThis suggests a fear of forgetting, a frantic attempt to preserve experiences before they slip away.\nTheme 2: Love and the Desire to Hold Onto Moments\nThe heart of the poem is a love story intertwined with nostalgia. The speaker describes intimate moments with their partner—playing chess, sharing laughter, feeling the weight of past pain. There’s a sense of trying to freeze time, particularly in lines like:\n\nI want to cherish this moment for a little while longer.\nPretending our familial pain is impermanent, promising things will be better tomorrow…\n\nThis highlights the contrast between what we wish to be permanent (love, connection, laughter) and what inevitably fades (memories, pain, even people).\nTheme 3: Love as an Anchor in Time’s Revolutions\nThe closing lines bring the poem full circle. The speaker reminisces about their first meeting, recalling how their partner asked:\n\nif I wanted to take a picture,\nasking if I wanted that moment to last.\n\nThis suggests that from the very beginning, there was an awareness of time’s fleeting nature—that love and connection are temporary, but we still seek to make them last, even if only in memory.\nSymbolism and Imagery - Chess: A symbol of strategy, time, and careful planning. The partner disregards strategy, suggesting they live in the moment, whereas the speaker overthinks. - Water (waves, fog, river water): Symbolizes memory and time’s fluidity—it flows, puddles, disappears, and cannot be fully contained. - Hand-holding and physical closeness: Represent a desire for permanence, for grounding oneself in the present moment despite the inevitable passing of time.\nFinal Thoughts\nThis poem beautifully captures the human struggle against transience—the attempt to preserve fleeting moments through memory, love, and poetry itself. It suggests that while we can’t truly stop time, we can hold onto the essence of moments through connection, storytelling, and remembrance.\nWould you like to incorporate these themes into your blog post? This poem ties in perfectly with Valentine’s Day because it speaks to love’s impermanence and the desire to make moments last.\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nI think that ChatGPT was able to do a pretty accurate analysis of the poem, however, it really dives into the symobolism and imagery way more over the way a human would describe the emotion of the poem in their understanding."
